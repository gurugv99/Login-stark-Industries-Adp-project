<pre>The Marvel Civil War storyline is a major comic book event that took place within the Marvel Universe.
     It was written by Mark Millar and illustrated by Steve McNiven and was published by Marvel Comics
      from 2006 to 2007. The storyline also inspired the 2016 film "Captain America: Civil War" in the
       Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

    The Civil War event revolves around the controversial Superhuman Registration Act, a government
     initiative that requires all individuals with superhuman abilities to register their identities
      and powers with the government. The Act is supported by Iron Man (Tony Stark), who believes that
       superheroes need to be held accountable for their actions to prevent further tragedies. On the
        other hand, Captain America (Steve Rogers) opposes the Act, arguing that it infringes on
         personal liberties and secret identities.
    
    The conflict begins when a group of young superheroes, called the New Warriors, attempts to 
    capture a group of supervillains for a reality TV show. The mission goes wrong, resulting in
     a massive explosion that destroys a residential area and causes the deaths of hundreds of
      innocent people, including children. The incident sparks public outrage, and the government seizes
       the opportunity to push for the Superhuman Registration Act.
    
    As superheroes are divided on the issue, Iron Man becomes the public face of the pro-registration
     side, forming a group called the "Pro-Registration Forces." Captain America leads the opposition,
      forming a group called the "Secret Avengers" or the "Anti-Registration Forces.
      " The conflict quickly escalates into a full-blown civil war within the superhero community.
    
    Various Marvel heroes and villains take sides, leading to intense battles and personal conflicts.
     Spider-Man, initially siding with Iron Man and revealing his secret identity to the world,
      later switches sides to support Captain America. Other notable characters,
       such as Black Panther, Daredevil, and the Fantastic Four, are also involved in the conflict,
        each taking a stance based on their own beliefs and motivations.
    
    The storyline explores the ethical and moral dilemmas faced by superheroes and examines
     the consequences of their actions on innocent lives. It delves into themes of personal freedom,
      governmental oversight, and the nature of heroism. The Civil War storyline 
      culminates in a climactic showdown between Iron Man and Captain America. Ultimately,
       Captain America surrenders to prevent further bloodshed and is subsequently arrested.
    
    The aftermath of the Civil War has far-reaching consequences, with many superheroes
     changing their allegiances and the superhero community left fractured. The event also sets
      the stage for future storylines and conflicts within the Marvel Universe.
    
    Please note that the events and details described here are based on the comic book storyline
     and may differ slightly from the cinematic adaptation in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</pre>
