<pre>Jarvis, an acronym for "Just A Rather Very Intelligent System," is a prominent character in the
     Iron Man comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Originally conceived as an artificial
      intelligence system, Jarvis plays a vital role in the life of Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man.

    In the comics, Jarvis is introduced as the loyal butler of the Stark family. He serves as Tony
     Stark's personal assistant, handling various tasks such as managing Stark Industries and
      providing logistical support for his superhero activities. Jarvis is portrayed as a kind and
       fatherly figure, offering guidance and support to Tony during both his personal and
        superhero endeavors.
    
    In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Jarvis is adapted as an AI system developed by Tony Stark himself.
     Voiced by actor Paul Bettany, Jarvis is depicted as an advanced computer program with a
      distinctive British accent. He assists Tony Stark in running his high-tech suits, controlling
       his mansion, and analyzing data. Jarvis becomes an integral part of Tony's life,
        acting as a trusted companion and confidant.
    
    Throughout the MCU films, Jarvis showcases his intelligence, efficiency, and unwavering
     loyalty to Tony Stark. He plays a crucial role in helping Tony develop and refine his
      suits, providing real-time analysis and tactical support during battles. Jarvis also
       showcases a dry sense of humor, adding a touch of levity to intense situations.
    
    Jarvis's significance in the MCU expands further when he becomes the basis for another character
    , Vision. In "Avengers: Age of Ultron," Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use Jarvis's
     programming to create an android body, which is then infused with the Mind Stone. This
      fusion results in the birth of Vision, a powerful being with a combination of Jarvis's
       intellect and the Mind Stone's power.
    
    Jarvis's character arc takes a significant turn in "Avengers: Endgame" when Tony Stark,
     in a selfless act, sacrifices himself to defeat Thanos. Before his demise, Tony
      uploads a digital version of Jarvis into a new AI system called "F.R.I.D.A.Y."
       This ensures that Jarvis's legacy lives on, continuing to assist and support the
        Avengers in their future endeavors.
    
    Jarvis, both in the comics and the MCU, represents the embodiment of technological
     advancement and the indispensable aid he provides to Tony Stark/Iron Man. His unwavering loyalty
     , intelligence, and dry wit make him a beloved and memorable character,
      playing a crucial role in the Iron Man mythos. Whether as a trusted butler or an AI system,
       Jarvis remains an essential part of Tony Stark's journey and legacy as the armored Avenger.</pre>
