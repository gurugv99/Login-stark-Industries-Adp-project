<pre>The Nano Tech Suit, also referred to as the Mark L or Mark 50, is one of Tony Stark's most technologically
     advanced armor iterations in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here are some noteworthy aspects
     of the Nano Tech Suit:

    Nanoparticle Formation:
    The Nano Tech Suit is composed of nanobots or nanoparticles that can move independently and reconfigure
     themselves to form various structures and weapons. These nanobots are stored within the arc reactor
      located in Tony Stark's chest.
    
    Instant Suit Deployment:
    A remarkable feature of the Nano Tech Suit is its ability to deploy instantaneously. Tony can summon the
     suit with a mental command, causing the nanobots to rapidly assemble around his body, covering him
      in full armor within seconds.
    
    Shape-Shifting Abilities:
    The nanobots in the suit grant it shape-shifting capabilities. The armor can reshape itself into different
     forms and structures to adapt to various situations. It can create weapons, generate shields, or even
      transform into everyday objects for stealth purposes.
    
    Enhanced Strength and Durability:
    The Nano Tech Suit provides Iron Man with enhanced strength and durability. The nanobots reinforce the 
    armor, making it highly resistant to physical impacts, energy attacks, and extreme temperatures.
      This durability allows Tony to withstand powerful blows and survive in hazardous environments.
    
    Repulsor Technology:
    The Nano Tech Suit incorporates repulsor technology, which provides flight capabilities and allows Iron Man
     to unleash powerful repulsor blasts from his gauntlets and boots. These energy blasts can be used for
      offense or propulsion.
    
    Integrated AI Systems:
    The suit is equipped with an advanced artificial intelligence system, Friday, which assists Tony in combat
     and provides real-time analysis of tactical situations. The AI helps with data management, communications,
      and optimizing the suit's functionality.
    
    Vibranium Enhancement:
    In some iterations, the Nano Tech Suit has been enhanced with Vibranium, an incredibly strong and durable
     fictional metal. The addition of Vibranium further enhances the suit's defensive capabilities,
      making it more resistant to attacks.
    
    Self-Repairing Abilities:
    The nanobots in the suit possess self-repairing capabilities. If the armor sustains damage during combat,
     the nanobots can quickly regenerate and repair the affected areas, ensuring that Iron Man can
      continue fighting without interruption.
    
    The Nano Tech Suit represents a significant technological leap for Iron Man, providing him with
     incredible versatility, adaptability, and combat prowess. Its nanotechnology-based features make
      it a formidable asset in his arsenal, allowing him to face powerful adversaries and protect the world.</pre>

    and energy-based attacks.
   
   Flight Capabilities:
   Similar to previous Iron Man suits, the Mark 14 enables Stark to fly at high speeds and maneuver
    through the air with ease. It utilizes repulsor thrusters located in the boots and gauntlets,
     granting him agile aerial mobility.
   
   Offensive Systems:
   The suit is equipped with an array of offensive weaponry. It includes repulsor beams in the 
   gauntlets for ranged energy attacks, as well as micro-missiles and laser-guided munitions for
